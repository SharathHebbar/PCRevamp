This FAN CLUB…
No one here has a clue!

How could they not recognize
the brilliance that is LANCE?

He stands for justice!
He’s cool, and yet passionate!
He’s the greatest, LANCE!


Huh?
You…


Are you maybe…
… …

You are!
You are {RED}!

We were just talking about you!

We were talking about how an
incredibly good TRAINER appeared.

And that someone is you!
You’re so cool!

So, we decided that we’ll become
your FAN CLUB!

We all hope you’ll keep battling
and show us how cool you are.

That way, maybe other people will
become fans just like me.


I’ll always be cheering for you!

Go, {RED}, go!


I’ll always believe in you,
{RED}.

Please show the others what you’re
like when you battle seriously.


I’m sorry.
I was your fan before.

But now, you seem to have lost
the drive you had before.

Lately, I think {FD02} has been
a lot cooler.


Oh!
{RED}!

Everyone’s been all excited about
you recently.

I can understand why.
I know that you’re strong.

But, do you know what?

Once I became {FD02}’s fan,
I can’t just stop being a fan.


I think TRAINERS are so cool when
they’re battling.

Don’t you think so, too?


Oh! It’s {RED}!
Too cool!

Oh!
Oh, yeah!

Can you autograph something?
How about my shorts?


However hot it’s been…

And however cold it may get…

I’ve always believed in, and worn,
shorts!

I’m counting on you to keep
winning!

I believe in you just as much as
I believe in shorts!


BROCK’s my hero!
He’s a man among men!

Heheh, I got my mom to do
something for me.

I got her to embroider “BROCK”
on my shorts!


… …

… …
I’m BROCK’s fan!

Even if I were his only fan,
I swear it on my rock-hard will,
and on my shorts!

I’ll be his fan to the bitter end!


BROCK’s the last word on cool,
end of story!

Now there’s a guy who I want to
be like!


{RED}, I’ve had the pleasure of
watching you battle.

It brings back sweet memories of
my own long-lost youth.

May you continue to find success.
You have a fan in me!


I have journeyed far and wide
across the lands.

But never have I seen a TRAINER
of your magnificence.

Take courage in your abilities
and keep battling on!

Make that a promise to me,
my young idol!


Hmm…
And you are?

Were you hoping to sign up for
a membership in our FAN CLUB?


Ah, so you are the much-
talked-about {RED}.

You certainly do have the look of
a winner.

But for me to accept you as
a true POKéMON great…

… …

You’ve still a ways to go!


All of us gathered here are fans
of POKéMON TRAINERS.

The way they look in battle…
They are the picture of coolness.

Perhaps you will be talked about
here, too, if you keep winning.


It’s {RED}!
It’s {RED}!

I want to be like {RED} one day!


Everyone stopped being {RED}’s
fan…

But that means I can have {RED}
all to myself!

Yay! Go for it!
My one and only {RED}!


Do you know what?
I want to be like SABRINA!

I want to be a psychic girl just
like her!


Even if I’m the only one, I won’t
stop being SABRINA’s fan.

My dream is to be like SABRINA,
cute, but cool.

I want to be a psychic girl just
like her!


I wonder if I can become a cool
TRAINER one day?


Oh, man, oh, man!
Cool! Too cool!

…Huh?
No, not you.

Just the way you battle.
That’s cool.


Yo, {RED}!

Looks like I’m the only one left
out of your fans.

But, you know, I like being an only
fan… It’s less stressful.

Keep up and at it!


{FD02}’s cool, huh?
I love the way he talks.

I’d really relish a chance to meet
him in person once.


Huh, can you believe it?
Everyone turned into your fans.

So after all we’ve been through,
I’m the lone {FD02} fan?

Eh, being the one and only
{FD02} fan’s my style, anyway.


Oh, my goodness!
Is it really you, {RED}?

I have to tell you, I adore the
way you battle.

I hope you’ll keep at it.
I’ll be your number one fan!


Oh, my goodness!
If it isn’t {RED}!

It’s so disappointing… I realized
I’m your number-one-and-only fan!

Well, it can’t be helped!
Let me cheer you on, at least!

Hurray, hurray, {RED}!


Recently, {FD02} has been on
fire.

The way he battles… It’s just 
the way that I like it!


Oh, hello!
If it isn’t {RED}!

Lately, all everyone talks about
is you.

I’m feeling lonesome because I
prefer {FD02}.


Amazing!
{RED}, you really are amazing!

Instead of just watching, maybe
I should become a TRAINER, too.


I’m your only fan…
Sigh… This is lonely…

Can’t you try harder and make the
others take notice of you?


Master {FD02} is so dignified…
He is so my type.

Why can’t the others see the
dignity he simply oozes?


I believe in Master {FD02}
with all my heart.

Even if I am the only one to
believe in him.

I won’t ever feel lonesome, though.

Not if I keep thinking about Master
{FD02}.


Hiyah!

Your battling style is most
educational.

I hope that you will keep plugging
away at success, hiyah!


Instead of just watching others
battle, battle yourself!

…My DOJO’s MASTER chewed me out
like that…

But I won’t let that stop me from
being your fan!

I can’t stop being your fan!


Hiyah! There is but one TRAINER
who has my respect.

And that is none other than my
MASTER at the FIGHTING DOJO.

You should become a fan of my
MASTER like me! Hiyah!


Hiyah! I respect my MASTER at the
FIGHTING DOJO.

I will never become a fan of
anyone other than my MASTER!

I will even sneak out of the DOJO
to spread word of his greatness.

Hiyah!
