Professor Oak: Hello, <PLAYER>. Good to see you. I heard a lot about you. Your Pokédex must be close to complete? For all your hard work, I would like to give you something.
Professor Oak: Haha! What’s behind me... You must have figured it out right away. Yes, it is a Pokémon!
Professor Oak: You don’t see them very often in Kanto. Choose one and it’ll be yours! ...Go ahead!
So, you’re claiming the Fire Pokémon Charmander?
So, you’ve decided on the Water Pokémon Squirtle?
So, you want to go with the Grass Pokémon Bulbasaur?
This Pokémon is really quite energetic!
No need to hurry. Take your time.
<PLAYER> received the <MON> from Professor Oak!
Would you like to give a nickname to the <MON> you received?
Is <NICK> the nickname you want to give?
Huh? You have no room for it right now. Come back when you’ve made room.
Professor Oak: If a wild Pokémon appears, your Pokémon can battle it. With it at your side, you should be able to reach the next town... What am I saying? You already know all this! Hahaha!
Professor Oak: There is nothing more that I can do for you. Enjoy the rest of your journey with that new Pokémon!


Some Trainers rely on a Pokémon's potential alone. But you can use items and medicines to help improve a Pokémon's capabilities.

Mountain climbing and Pokémon are similar in a sense. They both come down to potential! I do not rely on items or medicines but rather potential and training for battle!
