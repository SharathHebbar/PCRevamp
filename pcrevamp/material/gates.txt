Route 11 Gate:
Lady: "I heard that ghosts started appearing in Lavender Town again just like they did three years ago. I don't understand why it happens, but it sure is scary."

Route 12 Gate:
Aide: "I'm one of Professor Oak's aides. But sorry, I won't give you any items. I'm just enjoying the view."
Man: "An old man told me that if you're lucky enough, you can see a rare island appear south of here. But I haven't seen anything yet. Maybe it's a problem with the binoculars?"

Route 15 Gate:
Lady: "Woah! You can see the Safari Zone from here. It's full of Pokémon I haven't seen before!"
Fisher: "Do you like fishing? If you do, you should try to catch every Magikarp form. There's plenty of them!"

Route 16 Gate:
Old woman: "The cycling road. I used to go cycling there when I was younger. Have you visited it?"

Route 18 Gate:
Engineer: "The cycling road has an amazing architecture, don't you think?"
Biker: "The slope is really steep, so I'm taking a break before going to Celadon."

And for Safari Zone Rest Houses:

Girl: "Kanto's Safari Zone is really big when you compare it with the ones from other regions."
Man: "The owner of the Safari Zone, Baoba, is on vacation now. I don't think he will return soon, since his house is for sale."
Scientist: "You can keep any item you find on the ground here. And since the Safari Game is closed, you can now get all of them at once!"
Lady: "This place used to be full of wild Pokémon. But now it seems to have wild trainers too!"
Old man: "It's easy to get lost here, but you can take a break at the rest houses like I do."
Woman: "I'm reading this Pokémon Journal. Koga is such an interesting person! I didn't know that he liked medicine."
Boy (with gameboy): "I'm listening music in my Music Player. There's so many good songs!"(edited)
